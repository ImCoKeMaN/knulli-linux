# knulli-emulators-drop  --  standalone emulators and ports, built out of tree
#
# Installs the payload of the packages in emulators.set instead of compiling
# them.  They are ~24 minutes of a board build and change far less often than
# the rest of the image, so they do not belong in every build.
#
# This package has NO SOURCE.  The drop is produced by harvest-drop.py from a
# build made with BR2_PACKAGE_KNULLI_EXTERNAL_EMULATORS unset -- see
# "make <board>-emulators-drop" -- and lives in a cache outside output/ so it
# survives "make <board>-clean" and is shared by every board on the ABI.
#
# It carries no libraries.  SDL2, ffmpeg, python3 and the rest are core firmware
# on their own merits and keep being built per board; the few that existed only
# for the emulators are held in the image by the gate symbol's select list.
